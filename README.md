BUILD YOUR PORTFOLIO PROJECT (WEEK 2): MVP COMPLETE

 am building a simple blogging platform that allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as comment on existing posts.
PROGRESS:
·         On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate my Progress this week up to 8 out of 10. Because more understanding has taken position.
 
·         An explanation of my progress assessment this week is that, the Portfolio Project appears a strange Project to some of us, because we didn’t start it alongside other Projects in the ALX Programme. So, understanding the environment and preparing to start up our real Project (Specializations) is the key and that’s the stage I have just done.   
 
·         Parts of my Portfolio Projects completely as planned are: (1) Set up your development environment by the installation of a local web server (such as Ubuntu or WAMP), a text editor or IDE, and a database server (such as MySQL), (2) Define the tables and relationships necessary for storing blog posts and comments. This may include tables for users, blog posts, and comments, with appropriate foreign key relationships, (3) Create the user management system: Implement user registration and login functionality. This should include the ability for users to create and manage their accounts. (4) Create the frontend design: Design and implement the user interface for the blogging platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ensure that the look and feel are consistent and user-friendly, etc.
 
·         The aspect of my Portfolio Projects which are incomplete, and in progress are: (1) Build the blog post functionality. (2) Implement comment functionality. (3) Connect the front-end and back-end. (4) Test and debug
 
CHALLENGES:
·         The most difficult technical challenge that I encountered during the second week is that:  Cleaning data could be really messy if it’s not carefully checked for inconsistencies, in terms of smooth formatting, and other discrepancies. Arrangement and alignment of the data to make it suitable for analysis of my Project was extremely time-consuming. However, it is worth the stress. After cleaning, arranging, and aligning the date for the Project, it may require thorough preprocessing steps on how to make the selection, for proper normalization. It took me a hell of time to identify the techniques and also to decide which features to include or exclude which in turn became a very difficult challenge to my Project preparation research. The problem of scalability as it has to do with the volume of data expected to be ready for computations efficiently and effectively applied to the Project.
 
·         One of the most difficult non-technical challenges that I encountered during the second week was threatening, as it has to do with these underlying factors: Management of time which has to create a balance in the various aspects of my Project arrangement. Before I couldn’t understand that, I needed to collect data, analyze, review, and write, a chunk of my time was gone. That was how I started to prioritize my tasks, by allocating time effectively to the respective stages. Planning and organizing were other challenges that dragged my progress back as a clear roadmap and milestones for the Project were not really defined, to create a possible success of course. Also, managing large amounts of information posed a serious threat to me as if I should at that time or not, because walking through codes, and notes of other peers was overwhelming. Finding effective systems to organize and track this information is essential for the efficient work of any Project.
